done * debug straightforward pay
done - implement pop()
done - implement check()
- add rps calculation
  https://github.com/mxmCherry/movavg
- add latency calculation min/max/99
- make the number of workers configurable
    https://github.com/spenczar/tdigest
- make scylla/cassandra credentials configurable

- add --report-interval (default 5 seconds) reporting
  the latency min/max/99 and rps every report interval
- implement repair:
  * add handling for pending_transfer != transfer_id
  * add handling for client  mismatch
- populate should resume until it performs exactly N writes
- populate should generate dups
- populate should create accounts in a predictable way, so that
  nothing is loaded back on start of pay()
- use more lightweight logging, zerolog or zap
